base rules:
'<' := move pointer left.
'>' := move pointer right.
'+' := increment value at pointer.
'-' := decrement value at pointer.
'[' := start loop.
']' := if current value is greater than 0, return to last '['.
',' := set value at the pointer to next input character.
'.' := print the value at the pointer to the output.

additional rules:
function/import:
'{' := run the code contained in the file whose name appears after the brackets.
'}' := designates the end of the file name for the external code.
if statement:
'?' := if value at pointer is 0 skip to ';'.
';' := terminates conditional skip.
