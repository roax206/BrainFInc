# BrainF/Inc
An interpreter for a language based on the esoteric BrainFuck programming language in order to implement code reuse (ie functions) as well as conditional branching (if statements). This is done in a similar manner to C++ #include directive where a file may be read inline though in this case to describe and run complex lists of instructions. Unlike other projects revolving around BrainFuck which hope to create a language using the smallest compiler possible, this is based off of the concept that even the most unweildly languages can become usable if code labelling and reuse are implemented.
See design spec for language instructions(both those taken from the original BrainFuck language as well as those added in the derivative language).
The main component of the interpreter is the BrainFuncInterpreter class which implements the actual language and reads the BrainFunc code files (using the fileParser) where the Run class is used to give a executable program that can be run from the terminal(ie command prompt/IDE).
